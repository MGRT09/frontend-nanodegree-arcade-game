Udacity Project - Arcade Game
===============================

# Intro
This is my variation of the Udacity Frogger style arcade game. It is a very simplistic game, with a few enhancements over and above those in the Udacity rubric

## Sturcture
The structure is based around the files provided by Udacity, no further files or folders have been added. 
index.html - Initial html file to access the game
* /js/app.js - 
* /js/engine.js - 
* /js/resource.js
* /css/style.css
*/images/*.png


## GamePlay/Features
The game has the following elements. 

* Introduction splash screen
* movement controls for player
* pause and restart
* Game score and Lives
* End splash screen 
* Restart button

## Instructions
To run the game simply run the <code> index.html </code> 
Move the player around the screen with the arrow keys
lower case p will pause the game
lower case r will restart
The aim of the game is to get the player to the water at the top of the screen as many times with the 3 lives avaliable.
